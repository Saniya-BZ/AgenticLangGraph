LangGraph Chatbot Workflows
Worked on AI agent workflows built using LangGraph and LLMs, demonstrating use cases such as basic chatbot interaction, parallel task execution, customer review reply generation, prompt chaining, non-LLM workflows, UPSC essay drafting, X (Twitter) post generation, and fault-tolerant pipelines. Each workflow is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks with modular design for easy experimentation and extension.
